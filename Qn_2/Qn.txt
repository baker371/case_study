Hi LWASAMPIJJA,

Thank you for your interest in Greenlight Planet.

Post your first interview for the position of a Senior Insights Analyst, Uganda, we are happy to inform you that you have been selected to proceed to the Case Study Round.

You are required to prepare a 6-slide power-point presentation on the Case Study attached herein. This is to be submitted before 10am, on Friday 30th June 2023.

Do not hesitate to reach out to the undersigned for any inquiry.

When done, please share your case study presentation to these email addresses: hruganda@sunking.com, and francis.bitanyi@sunking.com.



The plot generated by the code provided is a pair plot, also known as a scatter plot matrix. It shows the pairwise relationships between the selected numerical variables in your DataFrame `df`. Each plot in the matrix represents the relationship between two variables.

In the given example, the numerical variables included in the pair plot are:

- 'Age': Represents the age of the individuals.
- 'Disabled Rate': Indicates the disabled rate for each individual.
- 'Repayment Speed': Reflects the speed at which individuals are making repayments.
- 'Total Amount Paid': Represents the total amount paid by each individual.
- 'Total Amount Post Upfront Amount': Indicates the total amount paid post an upfront amount.

The pair plot displays scatter plots along the diagonal and scatter plots with regression lines and histograms on the off-diagonal. Here's a breakdown of what each part of the pair plot represents:

- Diagonal Plots: The diagonal plots represent the distribution of each variable individually as histograms. They show the frequency or count of values for each variable.

- Off-diagonal Plots: The off-diagonal plots show the relationship between pairs of variables. Each scatter plot displays the values of one variable on the x-axis and the values of another variable on the y-axis. The points on the scatter plot represent individual data points. Additionally, regression lines are fitted to the data to depict any linear relationship between the variables.

The color of the points in the scatter plots is determined by the 'Unlocked' column. The 'Unlocked' column contains binary values (0 and 1), indicating whether an individual is unlocked or not. The color differentiation helps visualize any patterns or differences between the unlocked and non-unlocked groups in terms of the selected numerical variables.

By examining the scatter plots, you can gain insights into the relationships and potential correlations between the numerical variables. For example, you can observe how variables like 'Age', 'Disabled Rate', 'Repayment Speed', 'Total Amount Paid', and 'Total Amount Post Upfront Amount' relate to each other and how they might impact the unlocking status ('Unlocked').

Please note that the categorical columns ('County', 'Area', 'Gender', 'Accounts Product Family') were not included in the pair plot as they are not numerical variables.
